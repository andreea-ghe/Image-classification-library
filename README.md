## Image classification library
* Developed an Object-Oriented Programming library in C++ to classify	images.
* Incorporates advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning	algorithms.
* Implemented two main classifiers: 
 * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for	instance-based learning, optimizing the selection of hyperparameters and distance metrics for high accuracy.
 * Naive Bayes Classifier leveraging	probabilistic models for efficient real-time prediction.
* Achieved robust	evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, 	recall, and F1 score.
* Developed a user interface in Qt to facilitate model	training, testing, and data visualization.
